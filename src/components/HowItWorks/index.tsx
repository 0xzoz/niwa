        <FaqCard question="What is DEV?">
          DEV is a token to support your favorite creators and earn rewards. It allows for long-term support through
          staking, rather than temporary donations or trading. As a supporter, you can get exclusive NFTs for supporters
          and special Perks. ðŸŒ±
        </FaqCard>
        <FaqCard question="What is staking?">
          {/* eslint-disable-next-line react/no-unescaped-entities */}
          It's not a donation, but a temporary deposit of DEV tokens to financially support the creators. If you stop
          {/* eslint-disable-next-line react/no-unescaped-entities */}
          staking, the DEV token you deposited will be returned to you. It's like reusable money.
        </FaqCard>
        <FaqCard question="When can I receive my rewards?">
          Your reward will increase slightly every 15 seconds (1 block) while you are staking.
        </FaqCard>
        <FaqCard question="Can I cancel my staking?">
          Yes, you can easily manage your staking position at any time on stakes.social. Please go to
          <a href="https://stakes.social/">stakes.social</a> and use `Portfolio` feature.
